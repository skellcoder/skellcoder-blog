My blogging has never been my biggest strength.
The last blogging attempt was an whopping disaster, lasting for one post with maybe two-three sentence.
Hoping that this blog will be a bit more active.

So why should I have an blog? Since school I felt that I have stopped doing deep learning, with this blog I will try to 
go trough subjects I feel that I want to learn in more detail. I will also do it in public so I can improve my writing and force me
to actually do the writing.

## Content?

I will focus on programming and tech but may branch out. Topics I know I want to get a SOLID grip on is, 
SOLID, Tensorflow, learning more languages (Erlang, GO, Haskell) and possibly do a couple of posts with focus on a couple of good books (Clean code/r).

## Blog power
The blog is powered with [hugo](http://gohugo.io/), [wercker](http://www.wercker.com/) and deployed on github pages. 
My first thought was doing it with something simple like wordpress or medium. But then I found hugo a simple
static site generator built with GO. Don't know if the best platform but I got a good vibe when I started to use it.
Still a few kinks to work out with the layout but probably somebody has already had that problem and asked on SO.
You can see the progress (or lack of) on my [Github](https://github.com/skellcoder/skellcoder-blog).
